Solution: 


Step 1: Check Installation Path
Find where npm installed the Angular CLI: Run the following command to see where npm has installed the global packages:


npm root -g
This should output the global node_modules path. For example, it might be something like:


C:\Users\GMS_02\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules
Locate the ng executable: In the output of the path above (e.g., C:\Users\GMS_02\AppData\Roaming\npm), there should be an ng executable file in the main folder (not in node_modules).

Step 2: Add Path to Environment Variables
Copy the global npm path (e.g., C:\Users\GMS_02\AppData\Roaming\npm).

Update the System Path:

On Windows, open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables."
Select "Edit the system environment variables".
In the System Properties window, click on "Environment Variablesâ€¦".
Under System variables, scroll down and select "Path", then click Edit.
Add a New entry and paste the path from Step 1 (e.g., C:\Users\GMS_02\AppData\Roaming\npm).
Click OK to save all changes.
Restart Command Prompt: After making these changes, restart the Command Prompt or terminal for the new PATH settings to take effect.

Step 3: Verify Installation
Now try running:

ng version
